With the present explosion of data circulating the digital space, which is mostly non-structured textual data, there is a need to develop automatic text summarization tools that allow people to get insights from them easily. Currently, we enjoy quick access to enormous amounts of information. However, most of this information is redundant, insignificant, and may not convey the intended meaning. For example, if you are looking for specific information from an online news article, you may have to dig through its content and spend a lot of time weeding out the unnecessary stuff before getting the information you want. Therefore, using automatic text summarizers capable of extracting useful information that leaves out inessential and insignificant data is becoming vital. Implementing summarization can enhance the readability of documents, reduce the time spent in researching for information, and allow for more information to be fitted in a particular area.
